Adventure Works dbt Project
==========================

This repository contains a dbt project for exploring the Adventure Works dataset. The code is organized under the `aw_project` folder with the typical dbt structure:

* `models/` – staging queries and marts used to build dimensional tables
* `macros/` – custom macros including data tests such as `test_email_domain` and utility functions like `date_conv` for formatting dates
* `seeds/` – CSV files loaded as reference tables (for example `AW_QUOTA.csv`)
* `snapshots/`, `analyses/`, and `tests/` – placeholders for advanced dbt features
* `dbt_project.yml` – project configuration

The staging models (`stg_`) pull raw tables from the Adventure Works sources and rename fields. Intermediate models in `intermediate/` perform transformations and merges (for instance `merg_DimProduct.sql`). Final dimensional tables are built in the `marts/` directory, selecting from the intermediate models.

To run the project locally make sure dbt is installed and configured. Typical commands are:

```bash
dbt run

```

to execute the models and

```bash
dbt test
```

to run the custom data tests.
